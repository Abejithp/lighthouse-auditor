# Lighthouse Auditor

A Python-based automation tool that audits websites for accessibility using Google Lighthouse and records the results in a Google Sheets document. This tool is designed to streamline accessibility checks for multiple websites by automatically capturing scores and details, saving them in a centralized spreadsheet for easy review and tracking.

## Features

- Runs Google Lighthouse audits on a list of URLs provided in Google Sheets.
- Audits are focused on accessibility scoring.
- Results are written back to Google Sheets, including audit scores and details

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- npm 10.x
- Google Cloud project set up with Sheets API and OAuth credentials

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lighthouse-auditor.git
cd lighthouse-auditor
```

### 2. Set up a Google Cloud Project

1. **Create a new project** in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   
2. **Enable the Google Sheets API** for the project:
   - In the **APIs & Services** section, click **Library**.
   - Search for "Google Sheets API" and enable it for your project.

3. **Generate and download OAuth 2.0 credentials**:
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
   - If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen.
   - Under **Application type**, select **Desktop app**.
   - Click **Create** to generate your credentials, then download the JSON file.
   
4. **Save the credentials**:
   - Rename the downloaded file to `credentials.json`.
   - Place `credentials.json` in the root of your project directory.

### 3. Install dependencies

Set up a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install -g lighthouse
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory to store environment variables needed for the script. Add the following entries:

```plaintext
SPREADSHEET_ID=<Your Google Sheets spreadsheet ID>
LIGHTHOUSE_PATH=<Path to your Lighthouse CLI binary>
```

### 5. Prepare the Audit Configuration

The tool uses an `audit.json` file to configure the websites to be audited. This file includes the routes and the associated website URLs. Hereâ€™s the structure of the `audit.json` file:

```json
{
    "routes": {
        "home": "",
        "about": "about"
    },
    "websites": {
        "example" : "https://example.com/"
    }
}
```
To add new websites for auditing, simply include the website's name and URL in the websites section of the `audit.json` file. For example:

```json
{
    "routes": {
        "home": "",
        "about": "about"
    },
    "websites": {
        "example" : "https://example.com/",
        "newWebsite": "https://newwebsite.example.com/"
    }
}
```

Feel free to modify the structure of the audit.json file to suit your specific needs, as the current setup is designed for the Digital Scholarship Unit. Make sure to save your changes before running the audit tool. The script will read from this file and perform audits on the specified URLs.

## Usage

To start the auditing process, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py 1
```
This command will parse the URLs provided in the `audit.json` file along with the routes specified.

Alternatively, to check the `sitemap.xml` of the specified URLs, use:

```bash
python main.py 2
```

### Check the Results

After the auditing process completes, results will be saved in a reports folder generated at the root of the project. Each issue found during the audit will also be documented in your specified Google Sheet.

### Modify as Needed

Feel free to modify the code or configuration files to better suit your specific requirements or to add additional functionality.
